Java Largest of Three Integers Program
## GitHub Classroom Assignment for Java programming

Code up a Java program which gets three integers from the user and outputs the largest of the three and the sum of the three integers.

An approved solution is provided in this repo for you. Take a look at it and copy the style and format in your own program.

Comments from ChatGPT generated code is:

This program first creates a Scanner object to get input from the user. It then prompts the user to enter three integers, and stores them in variables num1, num2, and num3.

The program then determines the largest of the three integers using a series of if statements. It starts by assuming that num1 is the largest, and checks whether num2 or num3 are larger. If they are, it updates the value of largest accordingly.

Finally, the program calculates the sum of the three integers by adding them together, and outputs the largest integer and the sum of the integers using System.out.println().
